What is blockchain:
A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network.

What is smart contract:
They are a set of self-executing set of instructions without any third party intermediary. They get stored in the blockchain

The oracle problem:
Blockchains are a “walled garden” meaning that  whatever happens during a transaction happens in a box. But, if smart contracts want to be superior, they need to be able to communicate with the real world and outside of the block chain computation. 

What are oracle:
Oracles are devices that bring data into these blockchain or help compute data that the blockchain can interact with.
